                             What make Moo the best dog ever was he was so low maintance.
                             For a little dog he was not barky, very affectionate, playful,
                             full of personality and at times spunky. He was always at the door 
                             to great you when you arrived home and suggle with you the moment
                             you sat down. He loved sleeping under the covers with you and did
                             not move the entire night. One of his favorite things to do was sun
                             bathing by the screen door when the sun was shinning through. He 
                             tolerated getting dressed, grooming and bath time. Overall he was a
                             trooper about everything we tried with him.

                             Moo had all these secrete spots he loved to him in and we were forever 
                             calling him to see where he would appear up next. One time he caming 
                             running down the stairs sporting one of my sons undies half draped on
                             him it was the new fashion statement and had the whole family laughing
                             up a storm! He loved his stuffed animals which at times would be bigger 
                             then him. But his very favorite was Piggie, he would carry him around 
                             all the time, even after many washings Piggie still looked filty dirty.
                             But we didn't have the heart to throw it for we knew Moo would be looing 
                             for him for days. Here is a short Movie my oldest son made of Moo and Piggie.
